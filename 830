EDI 830

The EDI 830 Planning Schedule transaction set is essentially an electronic sales forecast. It can be used in one of three ways:
  As a sales forecast
  As a forecast and an authorization for the recipient to commit to resources
  As a forecast that also includes order release levels
  
The senders of 830 Planning Schedules are typically manufacturers communicating with their suppliers. As such, the two trading partners represent a buyer (the manufacturer) and a seller (the supplier). The Planning Schedule allows the seller to plan resources such as labor and material, and to fulfill orders automatically based on the customerâ€™s inventory levels. 830 transactions that include a Material Release are likely to include resource authorizations, period-to-date cumulative quantities, and shipping or delivery patterns for weekly, monthly or quarterly requirements. This can eliminate the need for the customer to generate separate Purchase Orders. This information in a single 830 transaction can relate to all production items sourced from a given supplier site. While the 830 transaction may include shipping information, it is based on forecasts. The 862 Shipping Schedule transaction is for conveying actual detailed shipping instructions.
